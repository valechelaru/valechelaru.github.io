    <h1>about</h1>
    <h2 id="about">about</h2>
<p>I am a physicist and I am currently working as a software engineer in the automotive sector. I am interested in testing of software and hardware, collecting data and setting up build processes for bigger projects. Besides science and technology I find many other things interesting. Some of those passions and little projects may end up as a post on this website.</p>

                <p>One afternoon I got really annoyed. I had to constantly switch between using my phone and my laptop
                    as a source for audio. Apple makes it of couse very easy when jumping from Apple device to Apple
                    device if they are connected to the same icloud account. But when you are using a iPhone and a Linux
                    machine it sadly does look very different.</p>
                <p>As I was starring at the same bluetooth settings for the n-th time that day I remembered that I had
                    once written a simple bash script that I used to connect to an old pair of bluetooth headphones.</p>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/valechelaru/f3282fa4614eedba0dc26536c38fbccc.js"></script>
                <p>A fairly primitive script that spams the <b>bluetoothctl connect</b> command in a while loop until
                    the connection with the device is established. If you want to use the script you will of course have
                    to edit it and put in the MAC adress of your device (instead of 00:00:00:00:00:00).</p>
                <p>Using only the <b>bluetoothctl connect</b> command should only work when the device was already
                    connected at least one time before. Else we have to pair and trust our bluetooth device manually
                    before being able to connect to it.</p>
                <p>Using this script as a basis we can create an indicator applet for the GNOME desktop in python. The
                    python script will create an handy little appindicator. By interacting with the extension we can
                    execute our bash script from above and connect and disconnect from our Airpods more easily. Before
                    we can do that we have to install the python bindings for AppIndicator. In Ubuntu this would be
                    <b>gir1.2-appindicator3</b>. The suffix 3 means that this version supports GTK3 based applications.
                </p>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/valechelaru/85b6dc499ad6504e67a78ab82e8b4fca.js"></script>
                <p>This python script creates the appindicator in the <b>main()</b> routine by calling
                    <b>Indicator.new()</b>. In <b>build_menu()</b> we create the GTK3 menu and add the different items
                    that trigger our scripts. The most important menu items are 'Connect Airpods' and 'Disconnect
                    Airpods'. It connects the menue items to the <b>connect()</b> and <b>disconnect()</b> routines. When
                    the functions are called by the menu callback they invoke <b>try_connect()</b> and
                    <b>try_disconnect()</b> respectively. The <b>notify.Notifications.new()</b> waits for the function
                    to return a result in form of a string. The <b>try_connect()</b> function starts our bash script
                    from before by creating a subprocess. The output of subprocess is the result of the bash script and
                    by checking this output then a 'Connection successful!' or a 'Connection failed!' is returned to the
                    <b>connect()</b> routine. The <b>Notification.new()</b> function then creates a GNOME notification
                    displaying this string.

                    class="responsiveImg" title="Notification when the Airpods are connected successfully.">
                <p>It works the same way with the disconnect routine.</p>
                <img loading="lazy" src="airpods-disconnected.png" alt="Airpods Disconnected Notification"
                    class="responsiveImg" title="Notification when the Airpods are disconnected successfully.">
                <p>For the sake of simplicity a different bash script is called. It can therefore look very simple:</p>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/valechelaru/a6df3216baa34ec67e4fdf58e6435812.js"></script>
                <p>Another small detail is, that the GNOME notification can carry our own icon (this is in this case
                    'airpods_icon.svg'). There ist also the possibility to use our own icon for our extension to be
                    displayed as our AppIndicator icon. In this example it is called 'airpods_icon_alt.svg'. You will
                    find both of these in the repository I will link to.</p>
                <p>The way I have this set up on my machine is, that the python script starts up automaticaly as an
                    Startup Application. This can be done by creating an entry in the Startup Applications Preferences.
                    For this to work properly the scripts need to be made executable (<b>chmod +x
                        <em>SCRIPTNAME</em></b>).</p>

                <p>This works for me like a charm and I hope you will enjoy this too. After disconnecting the Airpods
                    form my Linux box they even reconnect automaticaly by some magic back to my iPhone. The whole
                    project with all the needed files can be found in my <a

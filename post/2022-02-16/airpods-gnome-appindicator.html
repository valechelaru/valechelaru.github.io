                    <p>One afternoon I got really annoyed. I had to constantly switch between using my phone and my laptop as a source for audio. Apple makes it of couse very easy when jumping from Apple device to Apple device if they are  connected to the same icloud account. But when you are using a iPhone and a Linux machine it sadly does look very different.</p>
                    <p>As I was starring at the same bluetooth settings for the n-th time that day I remembered that I had once written a simple bash script that I used to connect to an old pair of bluetooth headphones.</p>
                    <script src="https://gist.github.com/valechelaru/f3282fa4614eedba0dc26536c38fbccc.js"></script>
                    <p>A fairly primitive script that spams the <b>bluetoothctl connect</b> command in a while loop until the connection with the device is established. If you want to use the script you will of course have to edit it and put in the MAC adress of your device (instead of 00:00:00:00:00:00).</p>
                    <p>Using only the <b>bluetoothctl connect</b> command should only work when the device was already connected at least one time before. Else we have to pair and trust our bluetooth device manually before being able to connect to it.</p>
                    <p>Using this script as a basis we can create an indicator applet for the GNOME desktop in python. The python script will create an handy little appindicator. By interacting with the extension we can execute our bash script from above and connect and disconnect from our Airpods more easily. Before we can do that we have to install the python bindings for AppIndicator. In Ubuntu this would be <b>gir1.2-appindicator3</b>. The suffix 3 means that this version supports GTK3 based applications.</p>
